// THIS FILE IS openXdox's NOW — § 3.4 slice S5, "contribute the gate loop"
// (openDox-spec `docs/front-end-package-boundary.md` § 5 row S5 @ `7d12428c`).
// It arrived here from openDox-code `src/opendox/web/views/gate-projects.js` and is
// SHIPPED AS PACKAGE DATA: RULED Q5 (openxFactory#656 comment `5648044785`,
// Brett Heap, 2026-09-12) — "the COMPOSED DEPLOYMENT assembles the bundle …
// the composed install copies them into openDox's one `--web-dir` at assembly;
// a contributed GET route is the declared hosted fallback". The bytes are
// placed by `openxdox.web_assets.install_view_modules()`; the fallback is
// `openxdox.serve_views`. The binding that declares it is in
// `src/openxdox/view_extensions.py`.
//
// WHAT IT MAY IMPORT FROM THE BUNDLE (RULED counterpart Q6, openxFactory#656
// comment `5649094228`, Brett Heap, 2026-09-12): `./views/helpers.js` AND
// NOTHING ELSE — every other need reaches the binding through its `ctx` (the
// names are declared in `view_extensions.CTX_MODEL_REACH`) or its own package.
// `tests/test_gate_loop_views.py` holds every module to it. This module
// imports: `./helpers.js` (the RULED guarantee) and nothing else.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE PROJECT COMMISSIONS — class B, and the second half of slice S4's answer to
// RULED Q3 (openxFactory#656 comment `5642758731`, Brett Heap, 2026-09-12):
// **"a route constant travels with the binding that calls it, never with the
// model that happens to declare it."**
//
// WHAT MOVED, AND FROM WHERE. `views/repo-selector.js` is the file openDox-spec
// `docs/front-end-package-boundary.md` § 3.2 describes as addressing ALL THREE
// COLUMNS from one place: openDox's `/project-register.json` and
// `/actions/refresh`, openXdox's `/snapshot-index.json` and its two
// `/actions/gate/*` project commissions, and openxFactory's own
// `/actions/apply-register-edits` lane. Q3 RULES it SPLIT: "the picker and the
// refresh affordance are class A; the two `/actions/gate/*` project commissions
// become a contributed binding with S4; `/actions/apply-register-edits` is
// openxFactory's lane and leaves the bundle entirely."
//
// THIS FILE IS THAT CONTRIBUTED BINDING. It owns the two gate routes, the
// create-project form that commissions a new project, and the membership-edit
// commission the repo filter's add line and trash controls raise. The PICKER
// stays where it was: choosing what you are looking at is the student's own
// gesture (§ 6 Q3: "moving it whole puts the project picker — the student's way
// to choose what they are working on — behind the gate column"), so only the
// COMMISSIONING half travels.
//
// A COMMISSION IS NOT A WRITE, and that is the whole posture the two routes
// carry with them: the POST records a project-register-edit descriptor plus a
// gate record, and the aggregation-owned register is edited only by the
// fulfilment. Refusals render `textContent`-only; a successful create retires
// the form for the session (the engine's duplicate guard is the backstop).
//
// HOW THE SELECTOR REACHES IT: through the S3 VIEW REGISTRY, never an import.
// `app.js` resolves the `gate.projects` binding once per render — exactly as it
// resolves `gate.bar` for the viewer — and hands `mountRepoSelector` the
// resolved mount, or null. Null is what a student install is: no "New Project…"
// line that acts, no create form, no add row, no trash control, and NO 404
// (§ 4.1's own promise, RULING C2 one tier out). That is `consumer_reach`'s
// posture in the browser: LATE, NAMED and REFUSABLE instead of an import-time
// dependency on a column that may not be installed (§ 4.2).
//
// AT S5 THIS FILE LEAVES THE BUNDLE. Its binding is declared in `app.js`'s CORE
// arm today and moves behind a contribution openXdox supplies (§ 5 S5); nothing
// in `repo-selector.js` changes when it does, which is the test of whether the
// seam was drawn in the right place — the reason this module is shaped as a
// binding with a `mount` entry and a returned controller rather than as two
// exported helpers the selector calls.
//
// TWO DEAD PARAMETERS DID NOT TRAVEL. The previous `mountCreateProject(wrap,
// status, roster, projects, o, addPendingOption)` never read `projects`, and
// `commissionEdit(body, control, restore)` never read `control` — both callers
// passed a value that the body ignored. Carrying an unread parameter across a
// package boundary would freeze a mistake into the contributed contract, so
// neither is in the signatures below.
//
// DOM-SAFETY, unchanged from the code's previous home: every dynamic value
// binds through `textContent` (helpers' `el`); no `innerHTML` is assigned here
// at all.
//
// A CREATED file: no row in openxFactory's `docs/opendox-carve-manifest.yaml`
// (RULED OQ-C), admitted by path in `docs/opendox-carve-admissions.yaml`.
