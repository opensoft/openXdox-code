// THIS FILE IS openXdox's NOW — § 3.4 slice S5, "contribute the gate loop"
// (openDox-spec `docs/front-end-package-boundary.md` § 5 row S5 @ `7d12428c`).
// It arrived here from openDox-code `src/opendox/web/views/swb-create.js` and is
// SHIPPED AS PACKAGE DATA: RULED Q5 (openxFactory#656 comment `5648044785`,
// Brett Heap, 2026-09-12) — "the COMPOSED DEPLOYMENT assembles the bundle …
// the composed install copies them into openDox's one `--web-dir` at assembly;
// a contributed GET route is the declared hosted fallback". The bytes are
// placed by `openxdox.web_assets.install_view_modules()`; the fallback is
// `openxdox.serve_views`. The binding that declares it is in
// `src/openxdox/view_extensions.py`.
//
// WHAT IT MAY IMPORT FROM THE BUNDLE (counterpart Q6). `./views/helpers.js` is
// the RULED guarantee; every other openDox module reached from here is declared
// in `view_extensions.BUNDLE_REACH` and held there by
// `tests/test_gate_loop_views.py`, so the reach is NAMED and checkable instead
// of silent. This module reaches: `./helpers.js` (RULED guarantee), `./dispose.js` (this column), `./staging-workbench-model.js`.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The staging workbench's CREATE-DOCUMENT affordance — dialog + transport
// (openxFactory `add-workbench-bullseye-and-create`, design D5/D7/D8).
//
// WHY THIS IS A SIBLING MODULE AND NOT PART OF staging-workbench.js: the view
// file is PINNED free of transport (test_staging_workbench.py asserts it carries
// no fetch call, no method literal, no XHR) and the pure model module is pinned
// import-free for its node harness. So the one write the workbench performs
// lives here, in the shape dispose.js / gate.js / lens.js already established:
// an injectable fetcher (`const doFetch = fetcher || fetch`), which is also what
// keeps this file out of test_renderer.py's pinned set of fetch-bearing bundle
// files.
//
// WHAT IT CAN DO: exactly one thing — bring a NEW document into existence
// through the human-only gate verb, which drives the tested authoring scaffold
// (`authoring.create_scaffold` -> `boundary.create_document`, create-only). It
// cannot edit, cannot delete, and cannot overwrite: an existing target refuses
// as a source-edit and the refusal renders here verbatim.
//
// GATE-OFF (design D8): with `caps.actions.gate` absent — the hosted static
// image, a non-loopback bind, an unresolved actor — no live control is rendered
// at all. The affordance becomes a COPYABLE CLI DESCRIPTOR carrying the seeded
// values, which is strictly more useful than a greyed-out button because it is
// the whole action, transportable to where the authority lives. Enforcement is
// at the route regardless; hiding the control is a courtesy, never the boundary.
//
// DOM-SAFETY: every dynamic value binds through textContent (helpers.el); the
// only innerHTML assignments are literal "" clears.

import { el } from "./helpers.js";
// `./dispose.js` is THIS COLUMN's own module, placed beside this one by the
// same assembly step (RULED Q5) — not a reach into openDox's bundle.

// ---- openDox's WORKBENCH MODEL, REACHED THROUGH `ctx` (RULED Q6) -----------
//
// RULED counterpart Q6 — Brett Heap, 2026-09-12, `opensoft/openxFactory#656`
// comment `5649094228`: "what a CONTRIBUTED view module may IMPORT from
// openDox's bundle: `./views/helpers.js` and NOTHING ELSE. Every other need
// reaches the binding through its `ctx` (Q1-Q4) or its own package (Q5)."
//
// This module named five things from openDox's `./staging-workbench-model.js`:
// the wire-shaping FUNCTIONS `createRequest`, `createDocumentCommand`,
// `consoleHeaders` and `withConsoleRepair`, and the VALUE `CONTINUATIONS`. All
// five are openDox's model — the shell hands them down as `ctx.model` (the
// module namespace it already imports), `installModel` takes it at each of the
// two entries, and every call site below reads exactly as it read before.
//
// ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH, NOT A COPY. Vendoring those five here would have put a
// second spelling of openDox's request bodies in a repository that does not own
// them, and the first divergence would be silent. Reaching through `ctx` keeps
// the model where it is and makes the dependency VISIBLE: `MODEL_NAMES` below
// is the whole of what this binding needs from the shell, and the mount refuses
// by name when the shell supplies less.
